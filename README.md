# Magic-Hackathon
24 Hour Game Project, MDC MAGIC Hackathon

Made by: Anthony Castillo

Description: This game is a game made exclusively using Python and Pygame. I aim to create a fun memory game with a unique twist. The goal is to have a grid of squares where random squares are highlighted with a color and the player must select the squares in the corresponding order that they appear. The game will have 3 difficulty settings: "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard". Regardless of the player's diffculty choice, the game will naturally become more difficult the higher the player's score, with the amount of time that a square is displayed decreasing and the amount of squares that are displayed increase. The ultimate goal is to creat unique rulesets for each colors and randomly select between a list of possible rulesets of each color so each game feels completely different and unique. An example of this could be a rule set where orange squares behave normally, green squares must all be selected 2 squares left of where they are displayed, and purple squares initiate a random minigame that the player must complete in order to select them. This leads to the game having a novel and unique concept making it fun to play dispite its simple gameplay loop.

Version 1.0:

Made the original gameplay loop and logic. Without any special rules.

Version 1.1: 

Made a start menu and logo (subject to change), the menu allows for players to select between difficulties however it currently does not have any gameplay effects during this version. Gameplay loop and logic remains unchanged at this point. Planning to add audio and animations.

Version 1.2:

Added a score and highscore system to the game.

Version 1.3:

Changed art for all aspects of the game, logo, and squares art. 8 bit theme. Added audio for theme music, wrong choices, and correct choices.

Final Hackathon Version!:

Added diffculty functionality, animations, game over logo, sounds, exe compatibility, etc.


Instrutions:
The latest version of pygame is required to run the executable.
Make sure to unzip the dist file into a folder as it is full of assests.
Depending on your operating system, the executible will be called Popping Pumpkins.exe or Popping Pumpkins.app

Make sure to install the latest version of pygame in your terminal. 
-pip install pygame
-pip install os

It is a simple memory game where you must click the pumpkins in the order in which they are displayed.

Enjoy the game!

With more time, I would love to implement different rulesets to each color and add more colors in the future so that every game is unique!
